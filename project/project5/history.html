    <h2>Have you ever wondered where dogs came from and how they became the most owned pet in the world? If so, welcome to Dogs as Pets: A Short History!</h2>

        <p>Although it may be hard to believe, your neighbors fluff ball Golden Retriever puppy was not always “Man’s Best Friend.” Dogs trace back to over 30,000 years ago when dogs had not yet split from their Gray Wolf ancestors. However, over thousands of years, dogs and wolves from Eurasia interbred with one another to form what we now know as the different dog breeds. However, what is most interesting is how over these thousands of years, dogs’ relationship with humans grew into one of companionship and love. 
        
        Around 9,000 years ago, the domestication of dogs began when hunter-gatherer societies introduced them as hunting allies and protectors. Breeds, including German Shepherds, developed relationships with humans due to their herding abilities for livestock. Although some still use dogs for these purposes, dogs as we know it are known for their companionship and social role in human lives. 
        
        In addition to being the most beloved pet in the world, dogs have been trained to serve as guides for blind and disabled owners, as therapy dogs in hospitals and nursing homes, and as police dogs! Humans learned throughout history that dogs could be bred specifically for these tasks; Although they have the same five senses as humans, dogs have an extremely efficient sense of smell and hearing, making them even better than humans at these tasks.

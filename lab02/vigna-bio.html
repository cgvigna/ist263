            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p>Outside of work, I really enjoy going to New York City or the Jersey 
            Shore! My favorite TV show is One Tree Hill and my favorite movie is the Sandlot! Growing up, 
            I lived with my two older brothers, my parents, and my Aunt Cindy. A fun fact about me is that 
            my favorite food is spaghetti! </p>

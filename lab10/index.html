            <h1>Caroline's Biography</h1>
            
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Caroline Vigna</strong> and I am an Information Management & Technology major in the iSchool. 
            I am concentrating in <strong>Data Analytics</strong> and I am interested in communicating and presenting data and 
            visualizations in order to make better business decisions. Some skills I have in this field include:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>R</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Tableau</li>
            </ol>
        
            
            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p>Outside of work, I really enjoy going to New York City or the Jersey 
            Shore! My favorite TV show is One Tree Hill and my favorite movie is the Sandlot! Growing up, 
            I lived with my two older brothers, my parents, and my Aunt Cindy. A fun fact about me is that 
            my favorite food is spaghetti! </p>
